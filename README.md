## Overview

This repository contains the code for performing semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds by leveraging range image representations. This approach transforms sparse 3D point clouds into dense 2D images, enabling the application of efficient 2D convolutional neural networks for pixel-wise classification, which corresponds to the semantic labels of the original 3D points.

**Key Features:**

* **Range Image Conversion:** Implements methods for projecting 3D lidar point clouds into 2D range images.
* **Modular Network Architecture:** Designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for the integration of various 2D backbone networks (e.g., Darknet53).
* **Customizable Data Loading:** Supports custom lidar datasets with provided tools for data preparation and loading.
* **Common Loss Functions:** Includes implementations of Dice Loss and Jaccard Loss, commonly used for segmentation tasks.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides tools for evaluating segmentation performance using standard metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU).
* **Training and Testing Pipelines:** Offers scripts for training models and evaluating them on unseen data.
* **Utility Tools:** Includes helpful scripts for data analysis and processing.

## Getting Started

This section outlines the steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python (>= 3.7)
* PyTorch (>= 1.8)
* CUDA (if you intend to use GPU acceleration)
* Other required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset Preparation

**[Instructions on how to prepare your lidar dataset will be added here.]**

Refer to the `data` directory for data loading and dataset-specific configurations.

### Configuration

The project utilizes YAML files for configuration. You can find example configuration files in the `configs` directory.

* `data_config.yaml`: Contains settings related to the dataset, such as file paths, class mappings, and data augmentation parameters.
* `darknet53.yaml`: An example configuration for a Darknet53-based segmentation model.

**[More details about the configuration options will be added here.]**

### Training

To train a model, use the `train.py` script with the desired configuration file:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
